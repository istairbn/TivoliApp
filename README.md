A Logscape App to get you started monitoring Tivoli XML.

This app is very simple, just zip the contents into TivoliApp-1.0.zip and deploy to your Logscape environment (requires 3 or greater)

The data source will assume your Tivoli install is as follows:
C:\Program Files\ibm\tivoli\common\CIT\logs

If different, amend the data source once deployed. 

The navigation on the left assumes you already have those 3 Logscape Apps - if you don't, they won't work!
